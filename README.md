## 📅 Week-wise Overview

### Week 1: Orientation & Setup
- Installed required packages (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, , Sklearn, NLTK)
- Loaded Twitter dataset and displayed first 10 rows  
📁 `Assignment 1`

### Week 2: Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates and missing values  
- Cleaned tweets by removing stopwords, punctuation, and applied stemming & lemmatization  
📁 `Assignment 2`

### Week 3: Data Visualization
- Visualized **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral** sentiments using bar plots  
📁 `Assignment 3`

### Week 5: Supervised Learning – Regression
- Applied regression to predict sentiment score probabilities  
📁 `Assignment 5`

### Week 6: Supervised Learning – Classification
- Implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest for sentiment classification  
📁 `Assignment 6`

### Week 7: Model Evaluation
- Evaluated models using **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**  
📁 `Assignment 7`
